## 🚀 Introduction

The **School Management System** leverages the power of **Spring Boot** and **React** to provide a comprehensive solution for educational institutions. It moves beyond monolithic limitations by adopting a distributed microservices approach, ensuring that each component (School, Teacher, Class, Student) operates independently yet cohesively.

## ✨ Features

### 🖥️ Core Modules
-   **🔐 Secure Authentication**: Centralized security via API Gateway using Spring Security (Basic Auth).
-   **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with visual charts and quick action shortcuts.
-   **🏫 School Management**: Comprehensive CRUD for managing school details, including name, address, and contact info.
-   **👨‍🏫 Teacher Management**: Register and manage teacher profiles, assigning them to specific schools.
-   **📚 Class Management**: Organize classes, assign teachers, and manage student capacity.
-   **🎓 Student Management**: Register students, track enrollments, and view detailed student profiles.
-   **📅 Attendance Management**: Track daily student attendance and generate reports.
-   **📝 Exam Management**: Schedule exams, record marks, and generate student report cards.
-   **📖 Library Management**: Manage book inventory, issue/return books, and track due dates.
-   **💰 Fee Management**: Generate fee invoices, record payments, and track outstanding dues.
-   **🗓️ Timetable Management**: Create and manage weekly class schedules and teacher assignments.

### ⚙️ Technical Capabilities
-   **⚡ Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication between services using **Apache Kafka** (e.g., Student registration triggers School updates).
-   **🛡️ Fault Tolerance**: Resilient system design with **Resilience4j** Circuit Breakers and Fallback mechanisms to handle service failures gracefully.
-   **🎨 Premium UI/UX**: Modern Glassmorphism design, responsive layout, and smooth animations built with React and Tailwind-like CSS.
-   **🔍 Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery using **Netflix Eureka**, allowing services to find each other without hardcoded URLs.
-   **🚪 API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, load balancing, and cross-cutting concerns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a **Microservices Architecture** pattern with the following key components:

### Architecture Highlights
-   **API Gateway Pattern**: Single entry point for all client requests (Port 8080)
-   **Service Discovery**: Automatic service registration and discovery via Eureka (Port 8761)
-   **Load Balancing**: Client-side load balancing through Spring Cloud LoadBalancer
-   **Circuit Breaker**: Fault tolerance with Resilience4j to prevent cascading failures
-   **Event-Driven Communication**: Asynchronous messaging using Apache Kafka for inter-service events
-   **Distributed Database**: Each microservice maintains its own H2 database for data isolation

-   **CSRF Protection**: Cross-site request forgery protection (configurable)
-   **Secure Headers**: HTTP security headers configuration

### Default Credentials
> [!WARNING]
> For production deployment, change the default credentials immediately!

-   **Username**: `admin`
-   **Password**: `password` (stored as BCrypt hash: `$2a$10$slYQMMLyC...`)

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Resilience

The system is designed to handle failures gracefully. If a microservice becomes unavailable, the API Gateway intercepts the failure and provides a fallback response, ensuring the user experience remains uninterrupted.

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Considerations

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before deploying to production:

1.  **Change Default Credentials**: Update username and password in `SecurityConfig.java`
2.  **Use Production Database**: Replace H2 with MySQL/PostgreSQL
3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Externalize configuration
4.  **Enable HTTPS**: Configure SSL/TLS certificates
5.  **Set Up Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring solutions
6.  **Scale Services**: Deploy multiple instances behind load balancers

### Docker Deployment

Package each service as a Docker container and use Kubernetes or Docker Swarm for orchestration.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Services not registering with Eureka**
-   Ensure Discovery Service is running on port 8761
-   Check `application.properties` for correct Eureka URL
-   Wait 30-60 seconds for registration to complete

**CORS errors in frontend**
-   Verify API Gateway CORS configuration includes your frontend URL
-   Check browser console for specific CORS error details

**Kafka connection issues**
-   Ensure Docker Desktop is running
-   Verify Kafka container is up: `docker ps`
-   Check Kafka logs: `docker-compose logs kafka`

**Authentication failures**
-   Verify credentials: `admin` / `password`
-   Clear browser cache and cookies
-   Check API Gateway logs for security errors
