## 🚀 Introduction

The **School Management System** leverages the power of **Spring Boot** and **React** to provide a comprehensive solution for educational institutions. It moves beyond monolithic limitations by adopting a distributed microservices approach, ensuring that each component (School, Teacher, Class, Student) operates independently yet cohesively.

## ✨ Features

## ✨ Features

### 🖥️ Core Modules
-   **🔐 Secure Authentication**: Centralized security via API Gateway using Spring Security (Basic Auth).
-   **📊 Interactive Dashboard**: Real-time analytics with visual charts and quick action shortcuts.
-   **🏫 School Management**: Comprehensive CRUD for managing school details, including name, address, and contact info.
-   **👨‍🏫 Teacher Management**: Register and manage teacher profiles, assigning them to specific schools.
-   **📚 Class Management**: Organize classes, assign teachers, and manage student capacity.
-   **🎓 Student Management**: Register students, track enrollments, and view detailed student profiles.
-   **📅 Attendance Management**: Track daily student attendance and generate reports.
-   **📝 Exam Management**: Schedule exams, record marks, and generate student report cards.
-   **📖 Library Management**: Manage book inventory, issue/return books, and track due dates.
-   **💰 Fee Management**: Generate fee invoices, record payments, and track outstanding dues.
-   **🗓️ Timetable Management**: Create and manage weekly class schedules and teacher assignments.

### ⚙️ Technical Capabilities
-   **⚡ Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous communication between services using **Apache Kafka** (e.g., Student registration triggers School updates).
-   **🛡️ Fault Tolerance**: Resilient system design with **Resilience4j** Circuit Breakers and Fallback mechanisms to handle service failures gracefully.
-   **🎨 Premium UI/UX**: Modern Glassmorphism design, responsive layout, and smooth animations built with React and Tailwind-like CSS.
-   **🔍 Service Discovery**: Dynamic service registration and discovery using **Netflix Eureka**, allowing services to find each other without hardcoded URLs.
-   **🚪 API Gateway**: Single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, load balancing, and cross-cutting concerns.

## 🏗️ Architecture

The system follows a standard Microservices pattern with an API Gateway and Service Discovery.

## 🛡️ Fault Tolerance & Resilience

The system is designed to handle failures gracefully. If a microservice becomes unavailable, the API Gateway intercepts the failure and provides a fallback response, ensuring the user experience remains uninterrupted.
